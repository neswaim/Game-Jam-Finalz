# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
Every Death Counts towards your bank account! By collecting treasures and gems from those who can no longer appreciate their value, you certainly appreciate them!

## Game Play
Search and rob graves throughout the map for their valuables all while avoiding the spooky ghost of the graveyard!
Use WSAD to navigate, hover mouse over gems to collect.

## Impediments
Many many struggles with combining our work in GitHub, as well as issues working out pathing of the enemy. It is surprisingly difficult to get the simplest concepts to function, such as a score system and enemy movement.

## Implementation
Night scene, ambient lights and emited light from player, enemy with enemy movement, collectable gems, etc.

None
## Future Development
Enemy pathing directly towards player rather than linear path, digable graves rather than open ones, etc.
